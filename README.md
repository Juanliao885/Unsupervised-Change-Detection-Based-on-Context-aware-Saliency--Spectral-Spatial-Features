Unsupervised Change Detection for Remotely Sensed Images Based on Context-aware Saliency- Spectral–Spatial Features and Weighted Coarse-to-Fine Fusion

Abstract: Saliency detection is a conventional computer vision technique used to identify salient regions in difference images for change detection (CD) in multi-temporal/bi-temporal remotely sensed images. To date, most saliency-based CD methods have primarily focused on profiling the colors and brightness of difference images, neglecting the rich spectral-space and context-aware features of remotely sensed image. Furthermore, these methods independently leverage the visual saliency features and spectral-spatial features of remote sensing images, without seamlessly integrating the two components. In response to this limitation, this paper proposed a novel CD method (MSDCD) based on context-aware saliency-spectral-spatial features and introduces a weighted coarse-to-fine fusion strategy. MSDCD makes full use of context-aware saliency features, spectral features, and spatial features from remotely sensed images. It summarizes the combination of these features into three principles: local low-level feature, global low-level feature, and high-level feature. Then, with the assistance of segmentation objects, MSDCD generates a single-scale salience map through global-local comparisons between object and its K-level neighborhood objects, employing the three principles of multi-level features. Finally, in accordance with principles 2 and 3, a weighted coarse-to-fine fusion strategy at the pixel-level is designed to incorporate multi-scale saliency maps. Fusion weights for pixels, from coarse-to-fine scale, are obtained adaptively by considering the heterogeneity of the object they belong to and the intensity difference between the pixel and the object. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed MSDCD method, eight comparative experiments to other state-of-the-art methods were conducted. The experimental results show that the MSDCD method better employs context-aware saliency-spectral-spatial features to preserve the details of CD map changes and reduce noise. Additionally, experiments conducted on three datasets with various region types, region areas, and spatial resolutions of remotely sensed images demonstrate the feasibility and transferability of the MSDCD method for change detection.

Requirements：Matlab 2020
Dataset:We use three datasets to evaluate our method:
1.LSCD:Image collection developed from LANDSAT images available on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website. The website offers images of various resolutions and provides detailed descriptions of changes that have occurred in the images. Accessible via Dropbox or Baidu Netdisk (b37d). 
Download:https://www.dropbox.com/s/1y03i19ov78vewc/corpus.zip?dl=0
2.OSCD:The OSCD dataset consists of 24 pairs of multispectral images captured by the Sentinel-2 satellite in 2015 and 2018. These images contain 13 bands and come in three spatial resolutions: 10m, 20m, and 60m. Fourteen pairs of images have corresponding pixel-level change annotations, which can be used to train and tune parameters for change detection algorithms. The change annotations for the remaining ten pairs of images have not been made public yet.
